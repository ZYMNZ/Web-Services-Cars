# Web Services project

## Overview
A REST Web Service, commonly referred to as Web API, allows client applications to access (retrieve)
and manage (create, delete, and update) data the service is providing. It uses a database to store the data it
manages and exposes this data as Web resources so that client applications can interact with it through
HTTPâ€™s uniform interface.
